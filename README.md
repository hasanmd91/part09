- Patientor Front End / Patientor Back End

The Patientor app is a medical record application that allows for the retrieval and updating of patient details and medical records. TypeScript was utilized in both the front end and back end to ensure proper handling of the diverse data types associated with medical records.

The RESTful back end provides endpoints for fetching and updating medical records. The front end has been expanded to include pages for displaying patient details and medical records. The addition of Formik and Yup enables the creation of maintainable forms for adding medical records. Semantic UI React was also employed in the project.
